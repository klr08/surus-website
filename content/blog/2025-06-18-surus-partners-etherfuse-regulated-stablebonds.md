Surus is pleased to announce a new partnership with **Etherfuse**—a pioneer in tokenizing sovereign debt and building interest-bearing stablecoins.

## What are Stablebonds?

Stablebonds represent a new category of digital assets that combine:
- The stability and yield of government bonds
- The programmability and efficiency of blockchain technology
- Regulatory compliance and institutional-grade custody

## Surus's Role

Through this partnership, Surus will provide:

- **Custody services** for the underlying bond assets
- **Trust company infrastructure** ensuring regulatory compliance
- **Reserve management** for optimal yield and liquidity
- **Bankruptcy-remote structures** protecting tokenholder assets

## Bridging TradFi and DeFi

This partnership exemplifies our mission to bridge traditional finance with decentralized finance. By providing regulated infrastructure for innovative products like Stablebonds, we're helping to bring institutional-quality assets onchain while maintaining full regulatory compliance.

> "Surus brings the custody backbone Etherfuse needs to scale across jurisdictions, products, and chains. From trust structures to real auditability, this is what compliant onchain finance looks like."

> **— David Taylor, CEO & Co-Founder, Etherfuse**

## The Future of Tokenized Bonds

The tokenization of traditional fixed-income assets represents a massive opportunity to bring efficiency, programmability, and global accessibility to bond markets. Our partnership with Etherfuse is just the beginning of what's possible when traditional finance meets blockchain innovation.
