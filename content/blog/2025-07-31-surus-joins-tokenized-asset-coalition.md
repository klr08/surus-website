**Surus is one of 24 new members to join the organization that aims to drive more than $1 trillion in assets onchain.**

We're excited to announce that Surus has joined the [Tokenized Asset Coalition](https://tokenizedassetcoalition.org/), a growing organization dedicated to accelerating the adoption of tokenized assets and driving regulatory clarity in the space.

The Coalition brings together leading financial institutions, technology companies, and infrastructure providers to collaborate on standards, best practices, and advocacy efforts that will help bring more than $1 trillion in assets onchain.

## Our Role in the Coalition

As a member of the Coalition, Surus will contribute our expertise in:

- **Regulatory compliance** for digital asset custody
- **Trust company operations** and fiduciary standards
- **Infrastructure development** for tokenized assets
- **Bridge building** between traditional finance and DeFi

## The Future of Tokenized Assets

The tokenized asset market has grown exponentially, with the potential to transform how we think about ownership, transfer, and management of real-world assets. By joining forces with other industry leaders, we're helping to build the infrastructure and regulatory framework needed to realize this potential.

We look forward to collaborating with our fellow Coalition members to drive innovation while maintaining the highest standards of compliance and security.
