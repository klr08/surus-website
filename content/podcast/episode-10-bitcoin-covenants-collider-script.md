In this episode, **Patrick Murck** sits down with **Ethan Heilman**, Research Engineer at **Cloudflare** and Bitcoin Research Collaborator at **MIT DCI**, to discuss the complexities of Bitcoin's scripting limitations, how Collider Script, a novel way to bridge Big Script and Small Script, is pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Bitcoin covenants, and what the future holds for programmable money.

**Key takeaways include:**

- **Bitcoin's Scripting Limitations:** Why Bitcoin's design restricts programmability—and why that matters.
- **ColliderScript & Covenants:** How a novel cryptographic approach enables complex spending conditions without protocol changes.
- **The Cost of Execution:** How the cost of executing a ColliderScript-based covenant is currently equivalent to the **electricity cost of buying a fighter jet**—and what could be done to make them more practical over time.
