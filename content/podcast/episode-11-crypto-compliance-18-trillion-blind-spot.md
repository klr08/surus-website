What if the current anti-money laundering system doesn't work—not just for crypto, but for anyone? In this episode, Patrick Murck sits down with **Rebecca Rettig** (Chief Legal Officer at Jito Labs) and **Mike Mosier** (Co-Founder at Arktouros, ex-FinCEN, ex-OFAC) to discuss the real limitations of today's compliance frameworks and what's needed to build a system that actually works.

**Key topics discussed:**

- The fundamental flaws in current AML systems
- Why traditional compliance doesn't work for digital assets
- Building effective compliance frameworks for the future
- The $18 trillion blind spot in current financial monitoring

This episode offers rare insights from compliance experts who have worked both inside government agencies and in the private sector building next-generation financial infrastructure.
