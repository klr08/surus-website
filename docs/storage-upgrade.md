# Surus CMS Storage Upgrade

## Overview

The Surus CMS has been upgraded to use IndexedDB for content storage instead of localStorage. This upgrade provides significantly more storage capacity and resolves the "QuotaExceededError" issues that were occurring when adding team members.

## Benefits

- **Increased Storage Capacity**: IndexedDB typically provides 50-100MB of storage compared to localStorage's ~5MB limit
- **Better Performance**: More efficient for large datasets
- **Quota Management**: No more storage quota errors when adding team members
- **Persistence**: IndexedDB data is less likely to be cleared by the browser

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The upgrade follows a layered approach:

1. **Low-Level Storage Layer**: `IndexedDBStorage.ts` - Direct interaction with IndexedDB
2. **Compatibility Layer**: `EnhancedContentManager.ts` - Maintains the same API as the original ContentManager
3. **Migration Support**: Automatic migration from localStorage to IndexedDB when the CMS loads

### Implementation

- We've maintained the same API as the original ContentManager to ensure backward compatibility
- All methods are now asynchronous (returning Promises) due to IndexedDB's asynchronous nature
- Data is automatically migrated from localStorage to IndexedDB on first use
- The storage layer is completely transparent to the rest of the application

### Data Structure

The IndexedDB database (`surus_cms_db`) contains three object stores:

1. `blog_posts`: Stores blog post data
2. `podcast_episodes`: Stores podcast episode data
3. `team_members`: Stores team member data

Each object store uses the `id` field as the key path.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the storage upgrade:

1. **Manual Migration**: Use the migration tool at `/migrate-to-indexeddb.html` to manually transfer data
2. **Clear Browser Data**: If problems persist, try clearing your browser's IndexedDB storage and restarting
3. **Backup First**: Always export a backup of your content before attempting any troubleshooting steps

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements to the storage system:

1. **Versioned Backups**: Automatic versioning of content with restore points
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Better handling of conflicts when multiple editors are working simultaneously
3. **Offline Support**: Enhanced offline editing capabilities
4. **Selective Publishing**: Publish specific content types independently
