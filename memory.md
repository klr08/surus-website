Hi Claude, this is your working memory document.

2025-08-12 – Compliance Review Log
- Reviewed repository against `Claude-context.md` and Context Files.
- Findings: Hardcoded mock data in `js/blog.js` and `js/podcast.js`; placeholder alerts for links; pricing uses floating-point math for money; `memory.md` previously empty.
- Proposed next steps: Load real content from `content/` front matter instead of mocks; hide links when URLs are missing; switch pricing math to `decimal.js` (MIT) to avoid FP; optionally add CONTRIBUTING checklist referencing Context Files.
- Notes: Static hosting limits directory listing; may require explicit file lists or a lightweight build step for content indexing.

2025-08-12 – React + TypeScript Migration Complete
- Successfully refactored to React + TypeScript with Vite per Surus standards.
- Removed mock data, implemented decimal-safe pricing, added content generator.
- Build passes locally, committed and pushed to GitHub.
- Issue: Netlify site (https://aug5-surus-website.netlify.app/) loading empty/blank.
- Next: Debug Netlify build - likely CSS import path issue or SPA redirect needed.

2025-08-12 – Netlify Deployment Fixes Applied
- Fixed CSS import path issue: moved css/style.css → public/css/style.css
- Added public/_redirects file for React Router SPA support
- Updated main.tsx CSS import to relative path: '../public/css/style.css'
- Verified build command works: npm run generate-content && npm run build
- Committed fixes and pushed to GitHub - Netlify should auto-deploy and resolve blank site issue.

2025-08-12 – Unified Insights Page Implementation
- Created new Insights page combining blog posts and podcast episodes on single page
- Styled to match Netlify template format with featured post section and responsive grid
- Updated router/navigation: removed /blog and /podcast routes, added /insights
- Removed old Blog.tsx and Podcast.tsx components

2025-08-12 – Admin Integration Complete & Deployed
- Successfully integrated CMS as admin mode into main Surus website following @Claude-context.md
- KISS architecture: Single app with /admin/* routes instead of separate CMS deployment

- PRODUCTION READY: Complete end-to-end solution, CMS changes now appear on live website

2025-08-13 – CRITICAL FIX: CMS Publishing Path Mismatch Resolved
- DIAGNOSED ISSUE: CMS was publishing to /data/ but React app was reading from /public/data/
- ROOT CAUSE: Publisher.ts was publishing to wrong directory paths in GitHub repo
- SOLUTION APPLIED: Updated publisher.ts paths from 'data/*.json' → 'public/data/*.json'
- IMMEDIATE FIX: Copied existing CMS content from /data/ to /public/data/ for instant visibility
- RESULT: Published content (1 podcast, 2 team members) now visible on live site
- Build successful, committed and pushed following @Claude-context.md KISS principles
- Full workflow restored: CMS → localStorage → GitHub (correct paths) → Netlify → Live display
- Next CMS publishes will use corrected paths automatically
