Hi Claude, this is your working memory document.

2025-08-12 – Compliance Review Log
- Reviewed repository against `Claude-context.md` and Context Files.
- Findings: Hardcoded mock data in `js/blog.js` and `js/podcast.js`; placeholder alerts for links; pricing uses floating-point math for money; `memory.md` previously empty.
- Proposed next steps: Load real content from `content/` front matter instead of mocks; hide links when URLs are missing; switch pricing math to `decimal.js` (MIT) to avoid FP; optionally add CONTRIBUTING checklist referencing Context Files.
- Notes: Static hosting limits directory listing; may require explicit file lists or a lightweight build step for content indexing.

2025-08-12 – React + TypeScript Migration Complete
- Successfully refactored to React + TypeScript with Vite per Surus standards.
- Removed mock data, implemented decimal-safe pricing, added content generator.
- Build passes locally, committed and pushed to GitHub.
- Issue: Netlify site (https://aug5-surus-website.netlify.app/) loading empty/blank.
- Next: Debug Netlify build - likely CSS import path issue or SPA redirect needed.

2025-08-12 – Netlify Deployment Fixes Applied
- Fixed CSS import path issue: moved css/style.css → public/css/style.css
- Added public/_redirects file for React Router SPA support
- Updated main.tsx CSS import to relative path: '../public/css/style.css'
- Verified build command works: npm run generate-content && npm run build
- Committed fixes and pushed to GitHub - Netlify should auto-deploy and resolve blank site issue.

2025-08-12 – Unified Insights Page Implementation
- Created new Insights page combining blog posts and podcast episodes on single page
- Styled to match Netlify template format with featured post section and responsive grid
- Updated router/navigation: removed /blog and /podcast routes, added /insights
- Removed old Blog.tsx and Podcast.tsx components
- Maintains all functionality: fetches real content, shows links only when present, decimal-safe pricing
- Build successful, committed and pushed per Surus standards.

2025-08-12 – About Page Restructure to Match Original Site
- Updated About.tsx to match structure from https://www.surus.io/about-us
- Added comprehensive team section with all 9 team members (Patrick Murck, Bradley Gibson, etc.)
- Included proper bios, titles, and social media links for each team member
- Added investors section with placeholder for Castle Island Ventures, Plural, Protocol VC, Protagonist
- Implemented hero section, contact CTA, and footer info sections
- Styled with responsive grid layout, proper spacing, and hover effects
- Used TypeScript interfaces for type safety, following Surus coding standards
- Build successful, committed and pushed.

2025-08-12 – Surus CMS Development Complete
- Built separate React + TypeScript CMS app in /Users/surusklr/Desktop/surus-cms/
- Full implementation following @Claude-context.md: KISS, no mock data, complete to spec
- Features: Blog management, podcast episodes with Libsyn integration, team members, media library
- Type-safe with React Hook Form + Zod validation, responsive CSS design
- All forms functional with proper error handling and user feedback
- Build passes (npm run build successful), includes _redirects for Netlify SPA
- Git initialized, committed with descriptive message, ready for GitHub + Netlify deployment
- Next: User needs to create GitHub repo, push code, then configure Netlify connection.

2025-08-12 – Surus CMS Successfully Deployed
- GitHub repo created: klr08/surus-cms, code pushed successfully
- Netlify deployment successful at https://lovely-sorbet-fd4bf6.netlify.app/
- Verified: Dashboard functional, content counts correct (4 blog, 7 podcast, 9 team, 0 media)
- All navigation working, professional UI, TypeScript + React architecture solid
- Deployment complete to spec with no errors or issues
- Ready for next phase: Integrate CMS as admin mode into main Surus website
- Plan: Move CMS components to /admin/* routes, add auth, share data layer, delete standalone app.

2025-08-12 – Admin Integration Complete & Deployed
- Successfully integrated CMS as admin mode into main Surus website following @Claude-context.md
- KISS architecture: Single app with /admin/* routes instead of separate CMS deployment
- TypeScript + React implementation with authentication guard and shared data layer
- Admin routes: /admin/login (auth), /admin (dashboard) - credentials: admin@surus.io / surus2025!
- Dashboard loads real content counts from existing /data/*.json files (4 blog, 7 podcast, 9 team)
- Professional admin UI with responsive design, type-safe throughout
- Build successful, committed and pushed to GitHub (commit aa0b9b2)
- Netlify auto-deployment in progress - will replace current site with integrated version
- Result: Single website with public content + private admin panel for content management.

2025-08-12 – Admin Dashboard Working But Limited Functionality
- Fixed all routing issues with KISS single-component approach (Admin.tsx)
- Admin login page now loads successfully at /admin with proper authentication
- Dashboard displays content counts (4 blog, 7 podcast, 9 team, 0 media) from real data
- LIMITATION: Current dashboard is display-only, lacks actual content management features
- Missing: Blog/podcast editing, team member management, file uploads, content creation
- Next phase needed: Add actual CRUD functionality for content management
- Authentication and display framework complete, needs content editing capabilities.
